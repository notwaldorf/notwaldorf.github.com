title: "Week 32: putting these on pause"
---
It's been  ~~one week since you looked at me~~ 8 months since I've been writing these weekly notes, and
I think I'm going to take a small break from it. It's been a good experiment, but I've been getting sloppy with remembering they're due, and it's starting to feel a bit self-indulgent. Because I don't actually advertise that they exist, I don't think anyone reads them, so I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing them if nobody on either side of the fence is particularly amused by the experience. I do have a blog post in the barrel which is a rare and momentuous occasion y'all can look forward to.

xoxo,
monica
