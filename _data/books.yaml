  title: Bad Publicity
  author: Bianca Gillam
  rating: 2.5
  read: 2024/09/26
  review: "A soft 2.5/5. The main trope is miscommunication with some alleged enemies to lovers peppered in. The pacing of this book was v odd — the first 75% is basically 'mean girl goes to work and is primarily unprofessional'. A lot of planes, airports and automobiles. Not a lot of chemistry between the 2 characters. Not even a lot of dialog between them, which made it really difficult to cheer for them when suddenly in the last 15% of the book everything gets resolved.
<br><br>Also, authors, a plea: it's deeply unrealistic that a woman in her 20s or 30s has exactly two contacts in her phone: her best friend (who she only has time for when it services her) and her mother. Please, I beg you: consider the existence of friendships. Or therapists.
<br><br>Thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for the e-arc. I’m sorry if I’m the mean girl in this review."

  title: Luminous
  author: Silvia Park
  rating: 4.5
  read: 2024/09/25
  review: "In a future where the line between human and robot is blurred, Silvia Parks asks: what 
  makes a person real, and what makes a thing a person? At its core, this book is literary fiction 
  and not hard sci-fi — robotic world building is forgone to focus on identity and the longing 
  for connection; these soft and messy ties that bind us. <br><br>Someone in the book summarizes 
  this dichotomy well: 'Do you think the lines I say have less value because you can track the 
  input data? What about the lines you say to each other? Aren’t they the same lines you downloaded 
  from thousands of sources?' It comes at a very relevant time, one of large AI models that 
  make paintings and write essays that we don’t want to call art. All I know is that in this 
  (very plausible tbh) future, there is everything in between children with robotic limbs, 
  humans that are monsters, and robots that are tender: all bags of flesh that want to feel less alone, 
  and that is at times both cruel and touching.<br><br>
  The writing is beautiful, if a bit slow to start. I am a sucker for a good line, 
  so quotes like 'Sometimes the heart can fail without war' really hit the spot for me."

  review: 'If you’ve ever wanted to wake up one day only to realize  Buffy/True Blood
    were basically documentaries, this book might be for you!<br/><br/>I was pleasantly
    surprised to discover this was a good-vs-evil-vampire-shenanigans book rather
    than a romance novel (absolutely minimal spice if you’re worried). It has: pop
    culture references, feminism, queer characters, fan fic about fan fic (it’s meta,
    think about it), witches, some serious topics (like sexual assault) but also some
    teen angst vibes (as a treat). And most importantly, an actual plot! <br/><br/>The
    only negative was that the writing was sometimes repetitive, but hey: I didn’t
    rewatch the entirety of Buffy at least twice for its literary writing.<br/><br/>Thanks
    to the publisher for (my first ever) e-arc.'

  review: Ashley Poston writes the slightly weird sweet stories, and I think that’s

    there’s ghosts, and sometimes there’s imaginary book towns, and even though the
    story or characters could do with 15 more minutes in the oven, you probably won’t
    regret nibbling on it. A raw cookie is still better than no cookie.

    just monologue for 50 pages at a time about their life and things they experience
    and how they interpret them internally, but they’re never talking with one another.
    It wasn’t for me, in the same way that reading philosophy isn’t for me: I do not

  review: I DNFed this book but not because it’s bad. It’s truly so beautifully written,
    like prose poetry, but I’m 60% in and absolutely nothing has happened. There’s
    only so much poetry I can read about the mundane of a slightly weird middle aged
    man. You know how people say they’d listen to Morgan Freeman read the phone book
    because his voice is so perfect? I feel like that about this book, only it turns
    out after 6 hours the phone book gets a bit slow.

    an exasperating shade of gray if we were all flawless.”<br/><br/>I love reading
    some of the community reviews for this book that are like “this worldview is so
    unlikely! I can’t believe humans would ever do this” because this is 100% absolutely
    what humans would do. The reason why I liked this book is because it’s not even
    the world building that’s grim — it’s the ending, and I can’t tell you why without

  review: Sometimes I felt the writing was a bit too “the little woman that could”
    for a story about serial killings, but it doesn’t hurt the story, or tbh the reader.
    The reality is that the 70s weren’t very kind to women. Even though this is fiction,
    it’s hard to read about the police incompetence, victim blaming, and homophobia
    and not believe it happened for realsies. It still happens now; of COURSE it happened
    to sorority girls in the 70s.

    as a concept, and unsurprisingly, I loved the magical realism stories the most:
    “Liddy, first to fly”,  “Sandman”, “June Bugs” were my absolute favourites. Normal
    situations infused with a weird and magical thing. In these stories, everything
    is possible. “Climbing nation”, on the other hand, lives entirely in the normal,

    reading it. When I say I like “fucked up books about fucked up people”, those
    people are not usually inherently awful, and I want to cheer for them. As this
    the book progresses, I have less and less empathy for the main character (which
    I don’t think is what the author intended). In the end, it’s a story about hubris
    and dramatic irony, which makes for a really stressful read. I think I really
    don’t like books with unlikeable narrators.

  review: 'I really disliked the writing style at first, but in the end, it’s the
    dry writing style that makes me like this book. It’s a composed, almost clinical
    retrospection of a deeply unhappy marriage and a shitty husband. Even though the
    writing feels detached and devoid of emotion, I don’t believe for a second the
    main character is. It’s a very honest story of the bad choices women make in relationships
    and the denial and blind hope they have that maybe they can fix it. It’s not written
    in an extremely sentimental way because shit happened, and nevertheless she persisted.<br/><br/>I
    read this in a review and really liked it: “Ginzburg, an antifascist, a feminist,
    and the first translator of Swann’s Way into Italian, writes for any woman eager
    to fit her bourgeois unhappiness to a form that can accommodate a quick and definitive
    ending. When should a woman kill her husband? Final answer: when it’s the only
    way to free yourself.” — https://www.publicbooks.org/b-sides-natalia-ginzburgs-the-dry-heart/'

  review: Ugh, this was not for me. It’s about not very nice people being cruel to
    each other, insufferable art school wankery, and very short sentences. I don’t
    know if toxicity is a common attribute of M/M queer relationships (which all but
    two are in the stories, and which I am not). I do know that in the two stories
    with women protagonists, the men are abusive and horrible to them, so all of this
    feels like a deliberate choice. In every single relationship described, sexual
    or not, at least one of the men is toxic, narcissistic and unable to produce an
    ounce of empathy. Was I supposed to feel hopeless with men as a genre when I was
    done with the book? Because I am. What a bleak, bleak novel.

    decided to read it though, and that was the first comment on it, by someone named
    Emma: “my favorite genre is literary fiction about messed up women doing crazy
    sh*t”. Girl, same.<br/><br/>This book was weird and at times gross in the same
    way a train wreck is: you can’t stop watching it and you’re not sure why. All
    the characters in this book are massive weirdos and not totally likeable; the
    story at times feels oddly clinical (a dry obgyn having sex with someone who transcribes
    interviews for a living? Brilliant!), and wildly violent and triggering at others.
    And yet? I kinda loved it. I thought the ending was kind of weak, but not enough
    to put me off the book.<br/><br/>This is for you if you like absurd realism and

  review: 'The good: this was a pretty accurate and often funny depiction of the misery
    of being a single woman in her 30s in 2023. The apps suck, the friends get weird,
    the men are insane, all on top of the other personal problems all human beings
    are plagued with. It’s all true; this story tells no lies. <br/><br/>My problem
    with this book is that I don’t know what it wants to be — it hits too close to
    home but isn’t satire, it is a light and easy read but isn’t a rom com, the characters
    are too generic for this to be truly about the people, and the criticism isn’t
    punchy enough to be more than feminism-lite.<br/><br/>I think I expected this
    to be more literary and less chick lit, and maybe that’s on me. But I also didn’t
    feel good when I was done reading; I thought “yeah, it’s not that great being
    a woman sometimes eh?” and I was bitter, and didn’t know where to go from there.'

    event? I still don’t know. At any point in the book I had no idea where the the
    story would go, and it was delightful. It’s got the same bananas vibes as Jennifer’s
    Body, with added satire about art school wankery, and a really good writing style.
    What a treat!

  review: 'Kevin Wilson writes weird stories and I like them. In both this and “Nothing
    to see here” you’re told the premise of the book in the first pages; you take
    it for granted, and then you read about the people around it. In this book, two
    teenagers make a poster that accidentally makes everyone go crazy. It’s like a
    memoir of a summer of absolute chaos that never actually happened. There’s not
    a ton of morals or lessons that you need to take out of it: it’s a weird story,
    and I liked it.'

  review: I’m not super sure I got what the book was about. I thought it was gonna
    be about Fiona and Jane’s friendship and how it changes over time, but in most
    of the stories, Fiona and Jane weren’t key parts of each others’ lives. I don’t
    know why the stories are out of order chronologically, and I don’t know why some
    characters are written from Fiona’s perspective — the voice is very similar to
    Jane’s, and it doesn’t add any Fiona-specific insight. It’s also not exactly adding
    insight about Jane’s view of the situation; they’re kind of “and then this happened
    to Fiona” chapters that are interesting to read, but I’m not sure I understand
    where they fit. I don’t mean to shit on this book, it was a fine read and I wasn’t
    mad about having read it. I just wanted a more cohesive plan, I guess.

  review: At some point in the pandemic I was in a deep existential depression with
    the world, and started listening to Jane Fonda narrate this book. I’d go on a
    walk, listen to a chapter and felt a bit better. Hearing her talk with so much
    honesty about her fuckups, regrets, feminism, activism, daddy issues, body issues,
    politics, boyfriends, etc, made her feel like my imaginary mentor and friend.
    I went on walks with her, she told me oddly relatable and personal stories from
    her life, and I learnt something about myself. I’m sure part of my adoration of
    this book (and tbh Jane Fonda the person) has to do with this strange routine
    I created around it. I’m also sure that now that it’s over, I dread taking a walk
    without it.

    I feel a bit cheated out of my full post-nineties teenage potential.<br/><br/>Anyway,
    this to say: this is a very Chuck Klosterman book. Most of his essays take 2 apparently
    unrelated pop culture subjects and connect them, like clear Coca Cola products
    and Radiohead (by going through mtv’s real world - climate change - biosphere

    crimes (yay!). Solving them was anticlimactic; everything fell into place, all

    reason this book irked me is that I have a pet peeve about murder mysteries that
    don’t give the reader a chance at solving the mystery. In this book problems were
    solved not by presenting a bunch of facts and you (and a character) being clever
    little squirrels and figuring it out. Someone would 1) realize they knew the answer
    but not tell you how, 2) confront whodunit, a character who hadn’t been developed

    news is that this is still prolly not the book you’re dreaming of reading.<br/><br/>The

    of it are really try hard; I left myself a note that is “Ersatz, ecru, echt, and
    be plus ultra in the first chapter? Yikes”. There’s also a random chapter that
    reads like a beat poetry stream of consciousness. I don’t mind authors experimenting
    with writing styles, but I didn’t think it was well thought out in this book.<br/><br/>I’m
    also starting to really dislike trauma porn as a means to advance a narrative
    (possibly because I’ve been ruined by the trauma queen herself, A Little Life).
    It didn’t feel it did anything to the story; yeah, it’s a conflict, but that could’ve
    been done with far less world rewriting.

  review: 'Good read! Very similar in vibe and style to The Martian, but this time

    have a problem? Sweet, we can totally fix it!” — is the recurring theme, and while
    it makes you feel good about how the story is progressing, the science cynic in
    me knows that’s not how it works. Surely something can stump our former-phd-now-high-school-science-teacher

  review: I usually like David Sedaris, and his neurotic, self deprecating humour,
    but this book hit a bit differently. The usual pettiness he has towards other
    people felt gross and like punching down - I’m sorry the blm protests made you
    go two weeks without in person shopping, that people don’t want to staff your
    favourite restaurant for like 4 cents an hour anymore, or that you *had* to buy
    another apartment (along to your other 7+ houses) because your husband had the
    audacity to want to play the piano. His sister did the same thing to get away
    from her rabbit, isn’t that what everyone does? <br/><br/>I think his stories
    used to me more relatable, but just reek of privilege; I don’t find humour in
    the bit where he offered to fix a stranger’s teeth cause he thought they were
    ugly, or the one about how his sister said she was abused by their dad and nobody
    in the family believed her (even though they knew the dad was “a bit of a creep”),
    or the one about how a long time ago he thought a black woman was somebody’s maid
    and it turned out to be his wife, and as a result he should get brownie points
    cause he doesn’t assume things about people anymore. These all feel like shitty
    things he’s done in the past, that aren’t ok now, and because he doesn’t understand
    why society now thinks they’re shitty, tries to spin it as humour. I didn’t feel
    good reading this.

  review: 'I like serial killers more than anything and I only finished this book
    out of spite (and by thumbing through a lot of the drivelling). I think I was
    tricked by the cover art that it was going to be a charming book with a plot;
    instead I got a harlequin romance at best?<br/><br/>The main character is really
    obnoxious and seems to only be able to speak in terms of 10 pop culture references
    per sentence (and dreadful inner monologues that never end), the love interest
    is given sufficiently little dialogue to be barely present, and the whole book
    could’ve been over in 20 pages with a phone call. Most disappointingly: nobody
    was actually a serial killer. Rough.<br/><br/>Unrelated: I’m always going to dislike
    a book if all the internal monologue happens mid sentence with another human (as
    if time stops for the other person during the 10 pages you’re reminiscing about
    the past to introduce context). Authors, surely you can do something else? Or
    at least, mix it up with something else? That’s not how humans work.'

    perfect lives, some crazy shit happens, and everything is wrapped up really neatly
    with plot holes the size of craters. <br/><br/>I really wish the author didn’t

  review: 'I don’t know what to write here. I’m not entirely sure whether this was
    scifi, literary fiction or social realism. The first third of the book was the
    closest thing to David Foster Wallace I’ve found, both in writing style and content;
    I am obsessed with that part. There’s an entire chapter on authenticity and how
    social media has destroyed it, and one man’s life-long quest  for witnessing and
    causing short, non-phony reactions from people. Another chapter is written from
    the perspective of a statistician, who sees the world as counts and probabilities.
    Another chapter is a list of field instructions a spy is writing to themselves.
    I love DFW, and of course, I loved this.<br/><br/>But, I’m not sure I understood
    the rest of the book correctly (and it’s why i couldn’t give it 5 stars). The
    chapters that I loved would absolutely stand on their own as short DFW style essays.
    The world itself is interesting: our social media is turned up to 11, and in this
    future we upload our consciousnesses to the cloud to replay them, or others’;
    some people are for it and some think it’s creepy. But that world isn’t explained
    like it would be in a scifi novel, so to me the book can’t be about that. Which
    means that (to me), this book is partly about people, partly a metaphor for our
    real, too online, too performative world we find ourselves in.'

    whimsical stories? When you’re a kid you get told short stories every evening,
    and you tell tall tales in return, and at some point we just stop. Well, this
    book tells you whimsical stories and it’s great”.<br/><br/>But then it turns out
    the stories are maybe not as unconnected as you thought. Characters from one story
    appear in a different story, and what you thought was just a whimsical story was
    maybe actually a metaphor, and before you know it the book is over and it’s too
    soon and you haven’t figured it out. I instantly wanted to reread it, so I could
    obsess and map everything out, but maybe there’s a reason why the author doesn’t
    warn you about this upfront. Maybe being dazzled is part of the experience.'

    which frustrates her, as it’s a standard that white authors aren’t held to. <br/><br/>I
    think that woman is this author, and this book, I think, is the book that she
    wanted to write. It’s a good rom com, where the characters just happen to be Black.
    They also happen to be liberals, feminists, mentors, southern, some dating dumb
    beautiful men, some writers of smut or writers of high literature, just like the
    world is. But the book is really about 2 kids being in love, ya know?'

    devastatingly sad read, and I irrationally felt like reading it was bad luck —
    if I read about her mum getting sick, will mine? Is this person’s relationship
    with their mother the same as mine? Is this how my mother feels about me, and
    is this how I will feel when she’s gone? Even writing this review is making me
    tear up; I feel like I’ve read someone’s diary, and have felt all of their feelings,

  review: 'Small note after a reread: just noticed that when the book is written in
    the third person, there’s no “she felt”, “she thought”. Everything is written
    as a script: you the reader are watching things happen, and drawing your own conclusions
    about the feelings of the characters. With a few very deliberate and obvious exceptions,
    Sally Rooney tells you absolutely nothing about what she thinks the characters
    are feeling. I love this. It puts the onus on you, the reader, to have empathy
    for the characters (or I guess, not have empathy and not enjoy the book). This
    made me like the book even more than the first time I read it.<br/><br/>——-<br/><br/>It
    is no news that I, like half of the millennials who read, <br/>am obsessed with
    Sally Rooney''s books. What might be news is that I''m in the controversial segment
    of the population that liked Conversations way more than Normal People (I promise
    this is relevant). In Norma People I thought that even though the relationship
    between the main characters was interesting, the people themselves weren''t: because
    we only had 2 characters, they were a bit too black and white and didn''t benefit
    from strong supporting characters to guide our understanding of them. <br/><br/>Beautiful
    world returns to that original multiple character setup from Conversations, which
    also means: I liked it a lot! Each character is flawed and has moments of lashing
    out, but they are also, in my opinion, an archetype of a Good Person (and I don''t
    mean that they''re saints, just that intrinsically they''re not bad people). I
    love books in which the characters are good, because they make me want to cheer
    for good things happening to them, which selfishly makes me feel good for caring.
    I even think this exact meta point comes up somewhere in this book! <br/><br/>On
    top of that, the letters between Eileen and Alice are these deep and smart discussions
    about society, class, capitalism, and the cult of celebrity that I really loved
    reading, and would love to revisit and think more about separate from the story
    itself.'

    very enjoyable (as evidenced by the fact that I read it in a day and a half and

    throughout. The main character is depressed, has mental health problems and is
    suicidal, and somehow the book wraps them all neatly in a “well if you just try
    to see the good bits and try a bit harder, everything will be ok!!!” bow which
    is a pretty messed up message. I thought I was going to get something about magic,
    got a really insensitive self-help soup instead. Sigh

  review: 'This book won the Governor General Literary Award in 1976. It’s a book
    about a lady who goes up north and gets biblical with a bear. Was it a dry spell
    for books that year? No, Margaret Atwood AND Michael Ondaatje had releases. Was
    the jury made of just bears? Maybe, but Alice Munro AND Mordecai Richler, humans,
    were on it. Yet, this book won. I obviously have to read it. <br/><br/>Update:
    oh man this is not a good book. I was hoping there was a metaphor, or some deep
    arc about humanity and loneliness, or romance satire. It isn’t either of those
    things, though the really awful Winnie the Pooh erotic fan fiction is occasionally
    hilarious (i can’t even make this up: there’s a scene where she literally slathers
    honey on herself to attract the bear). Imagine being Margaret Atwood and losing
    to this badly written bear porn that wouldn’t even pass muster in harlequin romance
    land. JUST IMAGINE.'

  review: I liked this book less than I liked the first one, because the first is
    all story and no explanation, and this one tries to explain things and make you
    a better citizen of the world. Stopping to think about what you’re doing to help
    the world is harder than reading a scifi about aliens. It’s tough work being an
    author, so I appreciate this one going straight up for the hard work.<br/><br/>Anyway,
    this was good; I enjoyed the story, I even surprised myself by enjoying the pop
    philosophy bits about humanity (“how ardently [we] believe in [our] individuality
    while simultaneously operating almost entirely as a collective”), reality (“not
    what is true, but what we pay attention to”), and power (“ability and desire without
    restriction”). <br/><br/>“The solution is, everywhere and always, the decentralization
    and redistribution of all forms of power”, and maybe if we communicated this to
    teenagers more through stories rather than stuffy philosophy books written in
    the antiquity, maybe more of us would believe it.

    aspects. Aliens pick a random human; shenanigans happen. Ender’s game was a bit
    sexist, stuck in the 80s, and only Ender was smart enough to solve puzzles; this
    book has a bi protagonist, a bunch of smart women, and everyone dreaming and solving
    puzzles as a team. It’s a very millennial book, with tweets and brands, and maybe
    you won’t like that, but if you’re a millennial like I am, who found out about

    maybe they ran into each other on the way to the beach. In a future life, maybe
    her and I will run into each other in a cafe and discover this fact as I apologize
    for accidentally taking her coat that looks just like mine. We’ll comment on how
    small the world really is, and I’ll say hey, it’s just like your books eh? In
    all of her books, characters weave in and out of each others’ lives, without anyone
    other than you, the reader, really putting it together. It’s a little secret Emily
    lets you in on. In some of her books (like this one) it works, in some (The Lola
    quartet) it doesn’t. Still, I’ll keep reading them all because I like being in
    on secrets, or because maybe i’m a character in someone else’s book.

    it in painful details, so that 5 books from now something very obscure makes sense
    for a very obscure reason, but the problem is that you end up with a very long
    book with a lot of explanations I didn’t care about and was just bored. Also,

  review: 'I am HERE for spilling the tea on the tech industry but this was a 500+
    page badly written medium post that was a slog to get through. It wasn’t the trashing
    I was promised, which is probably why this review is so long and the rating so
    low.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything you read you’ve heard before — maybe this
    book would’ve been novel 3-4 years ago, but who hasn’t read about the trash fire
    of sexism and sheer ridiculousness of tech by now? But even if I could get over
    the lukewarm takes and meh anecdotes, I can’t get over how bad the writing was.
    No exaggeration, on one page, this was the first word of every sentence: their,
    they, the, every, the, they, they. On top of that, almost every sentence has at
    least one (adjective)(adjective)(noun) flourish which just....isn’t great.<br/><br/>Also,
    the not-naming of companies is just exhausting and boring. Referring to Uber as
    “the ride sharing startup” and to Lyft as “the main competitor with cuter branding”
    isn’t keeping any secrets; everyone knows who that’s talking about. This air of
    insider knowledge (when in fact everything is very much public knowledge) is SO
    ironic because Anna Wiener is writing this book from the outside perspective of
    a sociology major who feels like they never quite fit in the tech industry, and
    hates everything about it, but in fact she writes exactly like one of those elitist
    tech bros who’s trying to feel better than you and make their startup sound more
    interesting than it is.'

  review: This is the Greek myth I wish I had read as a little girl. The stories I
    read were written by men, about men — most women characters were weak baby makers,
    gossipers, pretty things to look at, who only react to things the men do, but
    almost never _act_. The men were the warriors, the heroes, the ones who the story
    was really about. <br/><br/>This book is the feminist answer to that — Circe is
    a witch nymph who gives no fucks and takes no names. She doesn’t allow herself
    to be controlled by men, society, or her fate, and that independence makes her
    powerful, the same kind of power that all our favourite male gods in the old stories
    took for granted. And if now I were a 6 year old really into Greek myths, I really
    hope someone would give me this book.

    of airy and magical and nice. I also realized about half way through it was written

    the rock star. Year of the Monkey is a surrealist story where some people are
    real and some are not, and it’s not always clear which world you’re in at a given
    time. It was hard for me to get into it at first because I kept trying to figure
    out if a particular story _actually_ happened to Patti Smith or not, and it wasn’t
    until I let that go and accepted this book as “not actually a traditional memoir”
    that I started enjoying it so much more.

  review: 'Before I started reading this, someone described it as “devastating”, and
    I couldn’t understand that. But it’s true, that’s exactly what it is: devastating.
    It’s one of the bleakest books I’ve ever read, not because of the moments of grief
    and actual sadness, but because of the happy ones in between. And that’s why it’s
    devastating: because every time something good happens, you know it won’t last.
    It’s also one of the best books I’ve ever read — I don’t regret reading it, but
    I don’t think I can take the heartbreak of ever reading it again.'

    brilliant and the Charlie plot line was weak etc. but the fact of the matter is
    I couldn’t put this book down, I stayed up till 2am so that I could finish it,
    and if I’m too generous with the rating: tough cookies. They’re made up points
    anyway.'

  review: 'I don’t normally read a series this long, or this silly. I read these mostly
    on my phone: jetlagged in the middle of the night, in airports, at the dinner
    table, waiting for something or other to happen, or to stop happening. I read
    this particular book around toddlers who would interrupt me every 3 sentences,
    so I needed a book where the story would survive skipped sentences. If you’re
    ever in those situations, maybe these books will be there for you too.'

  rating: 5
  read: 2020/02/03
  review: 'This book is kind of brilliant! The premise is super smart (this isn’t
    a spoiler, it’s literally on the book cover): someone has to solve a murder by
    inhabiting 8 different witnesses and reliving the same day. It’s a bit slow in
    the middle while you’re figuring some things out, but the reveal is great, and
    makes the premise even neater. Very happy I read this.'

  review: 'I love all of Heather O’Neill’s stories, even as they break my heart in
    little pieces. That’s how a Heather O’Neill do. I loved this story too, but for
    some reason I didn’t love the writing style; I kept noticing the (definitely deliberate)
    short and choppy sentences which didn’t work out for me this time as they normally
    do. Still: happy I read this, sad when I was done reading it.'

  review: Fine for reading on a beach. It’s a story about rich, white, privileged
    people, having rich, white, privileged family problems that they have to deal
    with on their casual trip to Mallorca. Honestly, if you have a vampire book series
    to read on the beach, maybe do that instead.

  review: This is a lovely book about 2 generations of women being strong and badass
    and charming in their own ways. The plot is really well thought out, and the three
    seemingly separate story lines weave in and out in a way that doesn’t seem forced.
    A great feel-good read.

  review: The happiest I’ve been is when I finished this book knowing that it was
    over and I didn’t have to read any more of this just to “see what happens at the
    end”. All these books made me so angry. Weak af female protagonist that’s supposed
    to be a brilliant academic but is like really basic and defers to a man, and that
    man is a boring, rapy, rude one. A yikes from me.

  review: Look. It’s definitely not well written. And the plot is basically Twilight
    for adults but instead of vampires sparkling they’re like really grumpy and surly
    and into virginity and for some reason say “dieu!” a lot even though they’ve lived
    outside of France for decades and are scholars at the fanciest house in Oxford.
    But I read it in one night while jet lagged and I now need to know what happens
    in the next book so I feel I need to give it some stars because of this.

    to hard to be avant garde, and it just read really forced. Argh.

    felt hopeful while reading it and rather sad at the end, and that’s 100% why I
    feel I liked it less.

  review: I can't believe I didn't leave a review for this book. I think this is my
    favourite book that I've read in a long time. I thought so the first time I read
    it, and after re-reading it again today, it's still true. I think I see myself
    possibly too much in Frances, in a weird and emotionally unhealthy way, but empathize
    with and cheer for everyone in the book. It's all so beautiful and human and I
    love it.
