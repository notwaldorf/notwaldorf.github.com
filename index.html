<p>I've just ended an 8 year stint as a Senior Engineer at Google, where I worked on
  making music and art and all sorts of creative interactions with Machine Learning,
  web components and web standards, and the guts of Chromium.
  You can read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a> and my past work. Most of
  my personal code is on <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">GitHub</a> or
  on <a href="https://glitch.com/@notwaldorf">Glitch</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am available for freelance work in a consulting capacity, or as a tech advisor. If you would like to get in 
touch with me about working with you, <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email me</a> and we'll chat!

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I'm giving it a shot at writing weekly notes. You can browse the full
  <a href="/weaknotes">archive</a>, for as long as I manage to keep it up ðŸ˜….
  I also occasionally <a href="/blog">blog</a> about tech things that
  I've learnt or enjoyed, though the frequency of posts has really
  decreased lately.
</p>

<p><br>
  <b>RSS feeds</b>: <a href="/atom.xml">the firehose</a> | <a href="/blog.xml">just the blog</a> | <a href="/weaknotes.xml">just the weaknotes</a>.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I build very small (but cute, I think!)
  <a href="/projects">side projects</a>
  that are either an attempt at "art", or are a thing that I need in my
  life and can't find elsewhere (like, practicing ASL fingerspelling,
  ukulele chords, or uhhhh understanding time keeping in JavaScript).
</p>

<p>I sometimes also give <a href="/talks">talks</a> at conferences, though
  the pandemic has really thrown a wrench into that.</p>
