  <li>Chopped off 10 inches of my hair and I feel unstoppable. I always <em>think</em> I can deal with mermaid hair when the reality is I cba to brush it and it keeps getting longer and drier until I’m ready to take the kitchen scissors to it. I resisted that impulse and got a professional to cut it. Am I finally an adult?</li>
  <li>I am writing this update FROM A PLANE. Yes, a real plane. My brother-in-law’s family is moving into a new house and we’re going to celebrate. Also I haven’t seen their kids in a year and a half, which is 50% of one of them’s lives. She talks now! What!</li>
  <li>Update: the inner life of 3 year olds is outstanding. We are just guests in their world.</li>
  <li>Books: I finished the Vanishing Half and it was Very Good. I mostly avoided reading it because it has the most 2020 book style cover I’ve ever seen, but it was quite good despite that. Some weeks back I also finished On earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous and it was a bit of a miss for me. I like everything it was about (love a good immigrant memoir) but I didn’t enjoy the writing, which made the actual reading time a bit of a slog. I’m now reading The Lies of Locke Lamora because TikTok told me about it.</li>
  <li>Jake did <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398519620764581888?s=20">a lot of walking</a> for cancer (he’s against). He walked 100km in a row, in something like over 24h. As part of it he also did an hourly ama (or at least until he became a delirious shell of a man), and Frances and I (henceforth known as the <a href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1398765439770107904?s=20">chuckle sisters</a>) covered 6 shifts. It was good fun and I’m enormously proud of him.</li>
  <li>One of the best things about having a FitBit smart watch instead of an Apple one is that I can make my own faces really easily (in JavaScript!!!). I wanted something that looked very clean on the main screen but also had the option for a stats heavy second screen, and I could never find quite the right one so I made my own. Putting this work experience to good use!</li>
