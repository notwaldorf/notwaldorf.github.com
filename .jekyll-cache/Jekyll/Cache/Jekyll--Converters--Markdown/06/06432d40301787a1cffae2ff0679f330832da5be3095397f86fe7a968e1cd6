    <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/calico-switch/">Calico</a> came out and I finished it in 2 days! It’s an adorably cute game about running a pet cafe in a fantastical little world. It’s honestly the kind of game I would make. It has an incredible cooking activity interaction, which I can only describe as “shit, this game engine has physics and collision detection, let’s use it for something!”. It’s great. (spoilers if you don’t want to play it: the interaction is “you turn into a smol person and throw the cooking ingredients that are now bigger than you at a giant bowl”. it’s wonderful.)</p>

    <p>I am now playing Fenyx Rising on the Switch because it looked like a Zelda Breath of the Wild clone and can confirm: it’s basically BOTW minus cooking plus quality of life improvements (swords don’t break! more looting and outfits!) and sassy greek gods. Don’t know how the Ubisoft lawyers managed to sweep that under the rug, but I for one welcome the 50+ hours of gameplay ahead of me.</p>

    <p>I tried to make a Queen of Puddings desert because I saw it on celebrity bakeoff and like Dizzee Rascal (self proclaimed literal first time baker) managed to follow the recipe and do it so I felt overconfident. My custard didn’t set; I would’ve come last in the technical challenge. Also, it was WAY too sweet in my opinion, but at least that part wasn’t my fault.</p>

    <p>I also made my own homemade kaya! I discovered kaya when I was in Singapore 2 years ago, and it was life changing. A kaya toast set is probably my favourite breakfast concept, and I missed having it since I ran out of the Ya Kun kaya I bought on that trip. Worry no more: I am back on that bullshit.</p>

    <p>I am doing a 2 week <a href="https://www.chloeting.com/program/2020/two-weeks-shred-challenge.html">Chloe Ting program</a>, which means I have exercised every day this week. This is a huge record that I am very proud of, because I think exercising is the most boring and awful activity in the universe. I hated every minute of it, but by Sunday the minutes SEEM to at least pass faster? I dunno fam, it’s not great.</p>

    <p>I’ve started cross stitching while watching the Mentalist. It feels…oddly relaxing? I have no idea what I’m going to do with the result of cross stitching though, hang it in a bathroom somewhere? Is it too early to go down the pensioner aesthetic route?</p>

    <p>The linocut print of generated-with-javascript tree ring is almost done! I’ve been making some test prints, and they’re cute! I think I’m going to write a blog post about the process because I am very happy with it!</p>

    <p>I think summer is coming. Better get that SPF out.</p>
