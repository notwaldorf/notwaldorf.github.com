<p>When you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> CSS property on a box (with a value different than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">none</code>), this box
must be laid out according to the <strong>float positioning algorithm</strong>. Loosely, it says:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the box has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:left</code>, the box is positioned at the beginning of the line box</li>
  <li>if the box has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:right</code>, the box is positioned at the end of the line box</li>
  <li>text (and more generally anything within the normal, non-floaty flow) is laid out along the edges of the floating boxes</li>
  <li>the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clear</code> property changes the floating behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, in general youâ€™ll have a better time if you use a flexbox or CSS grid instead of floats, because floats are quirky and have strange edge cases, but if you were ever curious
about how the algorithm would choose where to position different floats, hereâ€™s a demo
(which you can also play with directly on <a href="https://float-layout.glitch.me">glitch</a>):</p>
