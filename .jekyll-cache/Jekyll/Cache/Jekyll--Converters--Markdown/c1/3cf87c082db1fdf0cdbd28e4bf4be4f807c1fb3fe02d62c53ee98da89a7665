    <p>I took the whole week off because I was very tired of life. Itâ€™s the year anniversary of the last
time the world was normal and itâ€™s bringing me down. Between covid and immigration
delays itâ€™s looking very 50/50 on whether I can attend my closest cousinâ€™s wedding this fall in Romania,
and Iâ€™m beyond gutted at the thought of missing it. All I can do about it is wait, and thatâ€™s making the pandemic fatigue worse by a thousand.</p>

    <p>I made two <a href="https://meownica.studio/">prints</a> of Barnsley ferns. They looked cool
in the end, but they were a bit of a struggle. Barsnley ferns are these super popular fractals
that (spoilers) look like ferns, but honestly, fractals in general are not my favourite. These
ones come out of 4 equations and 6 parameters which sounds like would open a whole world of 
possibilities, but it turns out most combinations of values produce absolute trash. Which is fine,
but thatâ€™s not my style of generative art. Instead, I spent all my random numbers in trying to
paint the ferns like <a href="https://www.meownica.studio/product/ferns-single-edition">furry brush strokes</a> and <a href="https://www.meownica.studio/product/ode-to-barnsley-single-edition">letters</a> I donâ€™t think anyone other than me appreciates that ğŸ˜….</p>

    <p>I got deep into linocuts. Iâ€™ve been trying to figure out how to make the things that come out of a computer also come out of my hands, and hand prints can definitely be that thing. Doing the linocut itself is my favourite kind of relaxing; it keeps my hands busy with stabbing squishy things (also see: that time
i picked up felting in meetings). I canâ€™t believe I havenâ€™t tried it before. Also, Frances says that the linocuts Iâ€™ve been doing look a lot like the kind of carving I used to do with my pottery, which is great news because that means I have a *~style~*.</p>

    <p>As usual, I am undeservedly lucky: one of my cousins, <a href="https://ralu.ca/">Raluca Iancu</a> is an enormously
talented printmaker and professor of printmaking, so I got to text her with questions. I donâ€™t think
everyone who starts up with a hobby can text a professional in that area and be like â€œhello I bought 10$
tools and some linoleum, please hold my feelings with your 10+ years of domain expertiseâ€.</p>

    <p>Zach and I have been babysitting our friendsâ€™ smol puppy. Her name is Penny and she is SO CUTE. The cat
feels infinitely betrayed.</p>

    <p>I am reading â€œWow, no thank youâ€ by Samantha Irby because she is hilarious and hates people almost
as much as I do. I just finished season 4 of Below Deck and I think I need to take a break because
I got way too invested in the romantic life of Ben the chef.</p>

    <p>I am looking for a chill, weekly â€œdraw thisâ€ prompt from instagram. If youâ€™re reading this and you
know one that youâ€™ve used or you like, please let me know!</p>
