    <p>I’ve been skipping weeks because a) literally nothing happens and b) I don’t have a good
system to update these notes. They’re a markdown file on a GitHub repo, and I kind of 
need a computer to edit it, but I also kind of don’t open my computer that much these days?
I also keep forgetting which day is Monday. Room for improvement.</p>

    <p>I wrote a <a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/tree-rings/">blog post</a> about how I generated some
tree rings in JavaScript and then carved them as a linocut. It doesn’t actually contain any
JavaScript, but it does have a lot of pretty images.</p>

    <p>The last normal thing I did before the panini started was go to Japantown and stock
up on apocalypse supplies (snackos, mucho ramen, milk tea powder, korean face things). 
The first normal thing I did with my 1 vaccine shot was go to Japantown and restock 
all the things. This wasn’t on purpose, but I am pleased with the serendipity. It is cherry blossom season, so it was very pretty, HOWEVER, some racist asshole vandalized two of the oldest cherry trees there in January. Literally chopped down all of the branches, one at a time. What the actual fuck.</p>

    <p>If you’re against plastic (why aren’t you?) and use deodorants, Dove has started selling <a href="https://www.dove.com/us/en/deodorants/refillable-deodorant.html">refillable</a> ones. I got mine from Target. The refill itself 
still comes in plastic, but overall it’s far less plastic than the obnoxious amount the normal ones have. I’m excited about this not because this deodorant is particularly amazing, but because Dove is a HUGE brand, and 
having mainstream brands start looking into more reusable, less-plastic products is a small but exciting progress.</p>

    <p>Speaking of waste, Zach bought <s>us</s> me the most amazing thing: a <a href="https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/shop/foodcycler-fc-50">foodcycler</a>!!! We’ve been composting for years, but I’ve recently started getting lazier about putting the compost back in the freezer when I’m done with it, so our idiot dog has been stealing a lot of compost (which is full of bad things for her like coffee grounds, onion peels, literally half a spaghetti squash rind she ate and threw up for 8 hours). This foodcycler thing takes the compost and dehydrates it and grinds it and in 4 hours is done and gives you back fertilizer at like a tenth of the original volume. We’ve had it for a week and it’s honestly THE MOST innovation I’ve seen in my kitchen.</p>
