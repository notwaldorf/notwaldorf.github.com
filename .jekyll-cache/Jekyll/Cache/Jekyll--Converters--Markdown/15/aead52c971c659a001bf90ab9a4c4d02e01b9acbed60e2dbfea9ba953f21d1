  <li>normalcy resumes chez nous. I know this isnâ€™t true everywhere, so if youâ€™re in a place of lockdown: I am sorry for how annoying these updates will be. I was a good girl and bunkered down for over a year, and now Iâ€™ve got antibodies in spades and taking advantage of it.</li>
  <li>first trip of the after times: Monterey! Iâ€™d never been, because prior to last year we didnâ€™t have a car, and renting a car for a 2 hour trip always felt daunting. However, now we have a car, and San Francisco is full of lovely things just a drive away.</li>
  <li>aquarium is still on pandemic rules so I didnâ€™t get to see any ğŸ¦¦ğŸ¦¦ğŸ¦¦. Next time!</li>
  <li>left Hopper at a dog boarding place for half a day so that we could have brunch in Carmel â€œwithout the kidsâ€. First, paying for eggs I didnâ€™t cook was an incredible experience and I almost cried (this is a theme this month, every time I do something that was pedestrian and normal in the before times I get overwhelmed with emotion). Second, Hopper a) fooled the humans into somehow trusting sheâ€™s not a vacuum cleaner and promptly ate another dogâ€™s lunch and b) was a squirelly weirdo and mostly wanted to hang out around humans and not the other dogs, which is 60% her personality and 40% something she picked up in the apocalypse.</li>
  <li>had an <em>indoor</em> fancy dinner with fellow vaccinated friends, to celebrate our new superpowers, and the place had white Russian ice cream floats for desert and can I just say: yes.</li>
  <li>EUROVISION. Incredible showings from Iceland and Ukraine, and an absolute shit bouquet when it came to voting. Collusion has been a Eurovision classic since the dawn of time, but this year it was enraging. France, really? Discount Edith Piaf? What a travesty. Special mention however to the international conspiracy of letting the UK go to the final only to award them 0 points across the board. A masterpiece; well done everyone.</li>
