  <li>Weird flex: been making cheese fondue for lunch because I make the rules here.</li>
  <li>One of the (many) amazing things about being a Canadian living in California is that <em>this</em> state (unlike, say, no-rules-nevada) doesn’t recognize non-US driving licenses. This means that after almost 20 years of 
getting my first driver’s license I had to do the whole circus show (written test, road test, 
being treated like a teenager, etc) to be able to drive here. This week I finally bit the bullet
and a) drove daily which is wild and b) did my road test (passed with flying colours, I know you’re
wondering). Side effect: I don’t have to use my Quebec license when I get IDed in bars and go through through the whole apology that my birthday is in fact in french. Bouncers love that.</li>
  <li>Speaking of, I’ve misplaced my Quebec licence and that’s very irritating.</li>
  <li>Euro 2020 is on! As per, my heart team is the Netherlands and they’re
doing surprisingly well! They’ve been #blessed with a pretty easy group (rip group F) and I am not 
looking that gift horse in the mouth.</li>
  <li>It’s a month that ends in y so I’m trying to redo my site. Inspos: I really like how clean <a href="https://thefox.is/about">Karolina’s</a> is; I’m low key of obsessed with this <a href="http://yearinreview.creativedestructionlab.com/#">absurd cursor</a> from CDL.</li>
  <li>There’s a bear in Tahoe that I’m 100% convinced is just trolling our dog. He spent a whole day casually
pacing up and down next to our house, which sends Hopper into a fit of barking hysteria.</li>
  <li>Books: I finished Midnight Library and really didn’t like it, and Convenience Store Woman and it reminded me a lot of absurd theatre plays. I’m starting Klara and the Sun now.</li>
