I"ÜK<p>Since 2019-ish I‚Äôve been trying to write reviews for every book I read. 
You can follow these here, on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27136484-monica">Goodreads</a>, or as an
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list_rss/27136484?shelf=read">RSS feed</a>. I used to try 
to only read ‚Äúgood‚Äù literary fiction, but life is short, I am tired, and now that mix is eclectic. I try to be fair in reviews and not take away stars because a book is trash (in my universe, both Sally Rooney and Fourth Wing can get 5 stars).</p>

It has: pop culture references, feminism, queer characters, fan fic about fan fic (it‚Äôs meta, think about it), witches, some serious topics (like sexual assault) but also some teen angst vibes (as a treat). And most importantly, an actual plot! <br /><br />The only negative was that the writing was sometimes repetitive, but hey: I didn‚Äôt rewatch the entirety of Buffy at least twice for its literary writing.<br /><br />Thanks to the publisher for (my first ever) e-arc.</div>

Even though the writing feels detached and devoid of emotion, I don‚Äôt believe for a second the main character is. It‚Äôs a very honest story of the bad choices women make in relationships and the denial and blind hope they have that maybe they can fix it. It‚Äôs not written in an extremely sentimental way because shit happened, and nevertheless she persisted.<br /><br />I read this in a review and really liked it: ‚ÄúGinzburg, an antifascist, a feminist, and the first translator of Swann‚Äôs Way into Italian, writes for any woman eager to fit her bourgeois unhappiness to a form that can accommodate a quick and definitive ending.

Girl, same.<br /><br />This book was weird and at times gross in the same way a train wreck is: you can‚Äôt stop watching it and you‚Äôre not sure why. All the characters in this book are massive weirdos and not totally likeable; the story at times feels oddly clinical (a dry obgyn having sex with someone who transcribes interviews for a living? Brilliant!), and wildly violent and triggering at others. And yet? I kinda loved it. I thought the ending was kind of weak, but not enough to put me off the book.<br /><br />This is for you if you like absurd realism and big weirds; otherwise there‚Äôs a high chance you‚Äôll think it‚Äôs humourless and off the rails.</div>

It‚Äôs all true; this story tells no lies. <br /><br />My problem with this book is that I don‚Äôt know what it wants to be ‚Äî it hits too close to home but isn‚Äôt satire, it is a light and easy read but isn‚Äôt a rom com, the characters are too generic for this to be truly about the people, and the criticism isn‚Äôt punchy enough to be more than feminism-lite.<br /><br />I think I expected this to be more literary and less chick lit, and maybe that‚Äôs on me.

        <td><div>Like a rounded up 3 stars.<br /><br />I feel like the grinch who stole Christmas because everyone that I know loved this book and I didn‚Äôt. The first third of the book was a bit of a slog ‚Äî nothing really happened, the writing was slow, a hundred characters were introduced and it didn‚Äôt really grip me. Then finally: crimes (yay!). Solving them was anticlimactic; everything fell into place, all at once, way too quickly and easily. I didn‚Äôt really buy it.<br /><br />The other reason this book irked me is that I have a pet peeve about murder mysteries that don‚Äôt give the reader a chance at solving the mystery. In this book problems were solved not by presenting a bunch of facts and you (and a character) being clever little squirrels and figuring it out. Someone would 1) realize they knew the answer but not tell you how, 2) confront whodunit, a character who hadn‚Äôt been developed yet 3) they reveal everything and also give you their character exposition. You stood no chance.</div>

These all feel like shitty things he‚Äôs done in the past, that aren‚Äôt ok now, and because he doesn‚Äôt understand why society now thinks they‚Äôre shitty, tries to spin it as humour.

        <td><div>I don‚Äôt know what to write here. I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether this was scifi, literary fiction or social realism. The first third of the book was the closest thing to David Foster Wallace I‚Äôve found, both in writing style and content; I am obsessed with that part. There‚Äôs an entire chapter on authenticity and how social media has destroyed it, and one man‚Äôs life-long quest  for witnessing and causing short, non-phony reactions from people. Another chapter is written from the perspective of a statistician, who sees the world as counts and probabilities. Another chapter is a list of field instructions a spy is writing to themselves. I love DFW, and of course, I loved this.<br /><br />But, I‚Äôm not sure I understood the rest of the book correctly (and it‚Äôs why i couldn‚Äôt give it 5 stars). The chapters that I loved would absolutely stand on their own as short DFW style essays. The world itself is interesting: our social media is turned up to 11, and in this future we upload our consciousnesses to the cloud to replay them, or others‚Äô; some people are for it and some think it‚Äôs creepy. But that world isn‚Äôt explained like it would be in a scifi novel, so to me the book can‚Äôt be about that. Which means that (to me), this book is partly about people, partly a metaphor for our real, too online, too performative world we find ourselves in.</div>

Well, this book tells you whimsical stories and it‚Äôs great‚Äù.<br /><br />But then it turns out the stories are maybe not as unconnected as you thought. Characters from one story appear in a different story, and what you thought was just a whimsical story was maybe actually a metaphor, and before you know it the book is over and it‚Äôs too soon and you haven‚Äôt figured it out.

        <td><div>Small note after a reread: just noticed that when the book is written in the third person, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúshe felt‚Äù, ‚Äúshe thought‚Äù. Everything is written as a script: you the reader are watching things happen, and drawing your own conclusions about the feelings of the characters. With a few very deliberate and obvious exceptions, Sally Rooney tells you absolutely nothing about what she thinks the characters are feeling. I love this. It puts the onus on you, the reader, to have empathy for the characters (or I guess, not have empathy and not enjoy the book). This made me like the book even more than the first time I read it.<br /><br />‚Äî‚Äî-<br /><br />It is no news that I, like half of the millennials who read, <br />am obsessed with Sally Rooney's books. What might be news is that I'm in the controversial segment of the population that liked Conversations way more than Normal People (I promise this is relevant). In Norma People I thought that even though the relationship between the main characters was interesting, the people themselves weren't: because we only had 2 characters, they were a bit too black and white and didn't benefit from strong supporting characters to guide our understanding of them. <br /><br />Beautiful world returns to that original multiple character setup from Conversations, which also means: I liked it a lot! Each character is flawed and has moments of lashing out, but they are also, in my opinion, an archetype of a Good Person (and I don't mean that they're saints, just that intrinsically they're not bad people). I love books in which the characters are good, because they make me want to cheer for good things happening to them, which selfishly makes me feel good for caring. I even think this exact meta point comes up somewhere in this book! <br /><br />On top of that, the letters between Eileen and Alice are these deep and smart discussions about society, class, capitalism, and the cult of celebrity that I really loved reading, and would love to revisit and think more about separate from the story itself.</div>

I obviously have to read it. <br /><br />Update: oh man this is not a good book. I was hoping there was a metaphor, or some deep arc about humanity and loneliness, or romance satire. It isn‚Äôt either of those things, though the really awful Winnie the Pooh erotic fan fiction is occasionally hilarious (i can‚Äôt even make this up: there‚Äôs a scene where she literally slathers honey on herself to attract the bear). Imagine being Margaret Atwood and losing to this badly written bear porn that wouldn‚Äôt even pass muster in harlequin romance land. JUST IMAGINE.</div>

It‚Äôs tough work being an author, so I appreciate this one going straight up for the hard work.<br /><br />Anyway, this was good; I enjoyed the story, I even surprised myself by enjoying the pop philosophy bits about humanity (‚Äúhow ardently [we] believe in [our] individuality while simultaneously operating almost entirely as a collective‚Äù), reality (‚Äúnot what is true, but what we pay attention to‚Äù), and power (‚Äúability and desire without restriction‚Äù). <br /><br />‚ÄúThe solution is, everywhere and always, the decentralization and redistribution of all forms of power‚Äù, and maybe if we communicated this to teenagers more through stories rather than stuffy philosophy books written in the antiquity, maybe more of us would believe it.</div>

It wasn‚Äôt the trashing I was promised, which is probably why this review is so long and the rating so low.<br /><br />Pretty much everything you read you‚Äôve heard before ‚Äî maybe this book would‚Äôve been novel 3-4 years ago, but who hasn‚Äôt read about the trash fire of sexism and sheer ridiculousness of tech by now? But even if I could get over the lukewarm takes and meh anecdotes, I can‚Äôt get over how bad the writing was. No exaggeration, on one page, this was the first word of every sentence: their, they, the, every, the, they, they. On top of that, almost every sentence has at least one (adjective)(adjective)(noun) flourish which just....isn‚Äôt great.<br /><br />Also, the not-naming of companies is just exhausting and boring. Referring to Uber as ‚Äúthe ride sharing startup‚Äù and to Lyft as ‚Äúthe main competitor with cuter branding‚Äù isn‚Äôt keeping any secrets; everyone knows who that‚Äôs talking about. This air of insider knowledge (when in fact everything is very much public knowledge) is SO ironic because Anna Wiener is writing this book from the outside perspective of a sociology major who feels like they never quite fit in the tech industry, and hates everything about it, but in fact she writes exactly like one of those elitist tech bros who‚Äôs trying to feel better than you and make their startup sound more interesting than it is.</div>

The stories I read were written by men, about men ‚Äî most women characters were weak baby makers, gossipers, pretty things to look at, who only react to things the men do, but almost never _act_. The men were the warriors, the heroes, the ones who the story was really about. <br /><br />This book is the feminist answer to that ‚Äî Circe is a witch nymph who gives no fucks and takes no names. She doesn‚Äôt allow herself to be controlled by men, society, or her fate, and that independence makes her powerful, the same kind of power that all our favourite male gods in the old stories took for granted. And if now I were a 6 year old really into Greek myths, I really hope someone would give me this book.</div>
