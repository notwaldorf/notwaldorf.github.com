    <p>Still into soups: I made a bomb cream of broccoli. I also bought a new
<a href="https://www.orringtonfarms.com/product/orrington-farms-natural-vegan-chicken-flavored-base/">vegan broth base</a> to fuck with because buying the
cartons of broth is like buying bottled water aka: bad and wasteful.</p>

    <p>My dog’s skin is turning grey. I know this sounds funny but it’s like, a thing. There could be a number of reasons for this, but the most likely one is that she’s an inbred dumbass and allergic to something in her food, like chicken. Or she could be dying. In any case, she’s now on Fancy Food™️ which makes her insufferable. Related: pet nutrition is absolutely bonkers.</p>

    <p>If you’re trying to gauge what level of pandemic mental breakdown I’m at, I dyed
my hair pastel pink in the bathroom last week (Manic Panic blessing my life since 2001),
and this week I “rescued” a very sad looking croton from the grocery shop. I got
emotional that it was ugly and unloved and nobody else was going to care for it
because people only buy pretty plants, so I HAD to adopt it. I paid 3$ for this
privilege of bringing a plant with broken leaves into my house.</p>

    <p>New season of drag race! I know this will be very polarizing, but I kind of love
how insane Utica is. I also love Gottmik (and that Ru has finally pivoted to saying
“and may the best drag queen win”) and Tamisha. Still don’t understand the pork chop
gimmick, and I haven’t eaten a pork chop in like a year and a half so it makes me hungry.</p>

    <p>I had some really good meetings at work with super creative and inspiring
people, and it’s spilling into my personal life: I have 2 (TWO) ideas
for generative art projects, and 0 (ZERO) motivation to actually do them. I also
haven’t finished the Bach Menuet I started last week. What do I do instead with my
evenings you ask? Watch every single Trixie Mattel video on YouTube because that’s the journey I’m on.</p>
