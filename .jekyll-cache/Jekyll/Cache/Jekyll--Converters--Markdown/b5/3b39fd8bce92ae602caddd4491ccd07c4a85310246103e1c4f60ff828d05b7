    <p>Tahoe (where we currently live during this pannie-d) got a ton of snow this week, so Iâ€™ve been in winter mode. Went skiing on Friday, went snowshoeing on Sunday. My calves are on fire. Skiing is pretty safe; everyone is wearing masks, theyâ€™ve closed all the
lodges, and tbh nobody should be within 6 feet of me skiing on a good day.</p>

    <p>I can tell when I accidentally overdo it with the hobbies (which is every time I get excited about a new hobby) because I rapidly swing in the other
direction. I painted nothing this week, and I spent all weekend watching the entire season of Bling Empire in one day instead.</p>

  <li>
    <p>I knitted most of a
<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/quick-ombre-hat">hat</a>
and then unravelled it all because it had accumulated too many mistakes. Itâ€™s a really fun
knit so Iâ€™m not too bothered.</p>

    <p>I spent a lot of evenings frantically working on a visualization about plastic waste (new hobby alert) that nobody asked for. It started as â€œlemme do a quick thing to get better at d3 and
at asking questions about the dataâ€ and itâ€™s now a good 8+ hours of work in. Sure wish I wouldâ€™ve half assed it, because now itâ€™s not done and I donâ€™t really want to finish it.</p>

    <p>Still reading <a href="https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/">â€œBecause Internetâ€</a>; also started
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Travelling-Cat-Chronicles-Hiro-Arikawa/dp/0451491335">The Travelling Cat Chronicles</a>.</p>

    <p>I am really <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf/status/1354298108083990528?s=20">irritated and confused</a> by this Hangouts/Chat situation. I am on an iPhone, and
want to send <a href="https://fberriman.com/">Frances</a> stupid links, hot takes and photos. We canâ€™t use our respective
phoneâ€™s Messages app (because hers is over SMS which shits the bed on photos, and mine is Apple proprietary). We
were using Hangouts, but itâ€™s deprecated, and wanted to use Chat, but itâ€™s â€¦
enterprise only and peons canâ€™t start new conversations? Also Whatsapp is evil and
Signal spams all my contacts when I install it. What the fuck, I just want to talk
to non-Apple friends in 2021.</p>

    <p>February is a perfect calendar <a href="https://twitter.com/standupmaths/status/1356212992669589504?s=20">rectangle</a> and that is satisfying.</p>

    <p>Are week notes the new LiveJournal but without comments? Discuss.</p>
