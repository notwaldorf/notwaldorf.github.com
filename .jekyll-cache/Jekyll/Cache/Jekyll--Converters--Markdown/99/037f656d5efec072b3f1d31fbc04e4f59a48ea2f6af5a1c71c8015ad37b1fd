I"}<p>Inktober is a project where artists make an ink drawing every day for the
whole month of October. This year I did an inktober but ignored all the rules, and
made Internet Stuff™️ instead. That experiment lives <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me">here</a>, but
I want to tell you why I did it before you go ahead and judge it. I
think that it’s also important to tell you it was a huge pain in the ass just
in case you watched it unfold and thought I magically stuck every landing.</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The why</h2>
<p>“Art” is a word I struggle with a lot. I don’t think of myself as an artist, because
none of the things I make feel like art yet. At the same time, I obsess about these
things if I don’t feel they represent <em>me</em>, which is one of the
nigthmares of being an artist – hence the struggle. For example, I made pottery for well over a year
before I thought any of the mugs looked like what I wanted them to look like.
They looked fine, and they looked like mugs, but they weren’t the kind of mugs
I <em>wanted</em> to make.</p>

<p>In my opinion, one of the qualities you need to be an artist is to be
extremely creative. I am not extremely creative, but I believe that everything
in life can be learnt by grinding that level. So with inktober I wanted to
force myself to think creatively every day, for a whole month, and see if that
would level up my creativity.</p>

<h2 id="the-how">The how</h2>
<p>I don’t like open ended projects because I think they lead to
intellectual wankery instead of like, <em>actually doing the thing</em>, so I made up these rules
for my weird art experiment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it had to be somehow about the sheriff of circle punch [1]</li>
  <li>it shouldn’t take more than like, an hour</li>
  <li>it’s fine if I skipped weekends [2]</li>
</ul>

<p>[1] Honestly the first day of inktober was a joke to make fun of the hashtag
and my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fabrahamlincoln">Fabian</a>, who I troll
with a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Circle%20Game">circle punch</a>
any time I can. This of course ended up trolling me, because I did the whole fucking month
afterwards, so ain’t that the troller becoming the trollee. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/goatsandbacon">Bushra</a> came up with the name (“it’s always howdy,
never howthee”). <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40goatsandbacon%20%23inktober&amp;src=typd">Her inktober</a> was way better.</p>

<p>[2] I don’t work weekends, and if anyone tells you that “being creative”,
or “making art” doesn’t feel like work, don’t believe them. Nothing is a free lunch.</p>

<h2 id="the-aftermath">The aftermath</h2>
<p>I learnt a lot of CSS. A lot of the days ended up with me looking at Codepen
and trying to figure out what animation I could use that day. I learnt about
svg filters, and became really comfortable writing keyframes. I finally
managed to write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;</code>
without having to look it up. I only crashed my browser once.</p>

<p>Overall it was really, really hard, and I hated a lot of it.
A bunch of the days <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me/day-5.html">were</a> <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me/day-6.html">political</a>. Some of the days were <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me/day-8.html">freebies</a>. <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me/day-18.html">Day 18</a>
was my favourite. <a href="https://howthee.glitch.me/day-10.html">Day 10</a> almost
made me throw my laptop at the cat.</p>

<p>And you know what? I think it worked. I noticed that I was walking around all day
<em>looking</em> at everything, like artists look at everything, trying to see
what I could use for that day’s inktober. Once, when I was in
highschool, an art teacher set me up on a mentoring date with an art school major.
I told her half of the time I didn’t know what to paint, and she told me to
just look at things and make them weird. “It’s like the Eiffel tower, but like
melting over a bridge, you know?”. I didn’t know, but then on day 18
I took a drum beat and made it into a Franken-morphed sheriff. I wrote down
every idea that I had, and after the month was over, I still had ideas left over.
They’re not all good, but you can afford being picky when you’re out of the drought.</p>
