I"6<p><a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta.js</a> is a JavaScript library that helps you generate art and music
on the web. Itâ€™s also the team that I work on now! One of the things that I do
whenever I join a new team is learn a bunch of things, and then make a bunch of
tutorials that past Monica wouldâ€™ve loved to stumble over. This is one of them!</p>

<p>In this tutorial, weâ€™ll talk about the music generation bits in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@magenta/music</code> (one of the several libraries in Magenta.js) â€“
how to make your browser sing, and in particular, how to make your browser
sing <em>like you</em>!. The tutorial is interactive, and introductory
and <a href="https://hello-magenta.glitch.me/">on Glitch</a>. Go play with
all the examples, and have fun! ðŸ’•</p>
