I"§<p>This year was pretty shit, so I wasnâ€™t very keen on doing
one of these posts. So many of my favourite musicians died, so many of my
favourite countries made mistakes, so many of my favourite people are worried and
sad, and I am worried and sad with them. But this year was not the worst year
weâ€™ve ever had, or might ever have, so I will tell
you the good parts of my year. Maybe youâ€™ll tell me the good parts of yours,
and then for 3 minutes we will be less worried and sad, together. â¤ï¸</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s life as GitHub saw it. Red text is dumb projects Iâ€™ve shipped (you can
  tell because the names donâ€™t make sense), black text is
conferences Iâ€™ve spoken at:</p>

<p>When I first looked at this graph I freaked out,
because it looks like I did very little until April. Then someone reminded me
that I have a job that isnâ€™t writing emoji apps, so I probably
just you know, went to work and had normal evening hobbies like playing The Sims
and hanging out with my cat. It just takes 4 months before I get antsy.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s life as Instagram saw it. Iâ€™ve apparently started taking a lot more
selfies, which is either pretty vain or slightly more self confident, or letâ€™s be
honest, neither. This is also the first year when I took a lot of photos with my nice camera
when traveling, but didnâ€™t have the energy to process or post any of them. Shit
happens.</p>

<p>I love traveling almost as much as I love cheese (which is a lot),
and Iâ€™m so happy about all the places I got to go to this
year. I travelled every month that didnâ€™t start with an A. I went to 17 cities
and 8 countries.
In July, I was at home for a total of 9 days. I am lucky that I work on a team
that still tolerates the fact that every couple of months Iâ€™ll just be in a
different timezone, and Iâ€™m worried about when this will end and Iâ€™ll have to stand still.
My favourite trip
was going to Taiwan, which was a country I didnâ€™t expect to love as
much as I did.</p>

<p>I drank over 500 cups of coffee. I learnt about 60 traditional Chinese characters.
Iâ€™m not trying to learn how to speak the language, Iâ€™m just fascinated by the radicals and the writing and
the calligraphy and how some words are like a story. I might write a blog post
about it one day when Iâ€™m less nervous about it. I drew a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3168680-Polymerosaurus">dinosaur</a>. I still love my job.
I still didnâ€™t work on weekends. I still didnâ€™t spoil Star Wars for anybody. I turned 31.</p>

<p>I hope your year was ok, Internet friends.</p>
