I"Q<p>This Tuesday I gave my first talk in something like 4 years. I do a fair bit of
speaking on panels / teaching workshops / informal presentations, but I haven’t
actually got up in front of a crowd of strangers and tell them about something
I did since I left academia. Nobody threw any pizza crusts or beer bottles at my head, so I guess it didn’t go all that terrible.</p>

<p>Anyway, I talked about <a href="http://notwaldorf.github.io/posts/go-cat-dns-go/">cat-dns</a> at <a href="http://js-montreal.org/">js-montreal</a>. This is what the slides looked like. Imagine reading them in an over-caffeinated, high pitched voice, and it’ll be almost like you were there.</p>
