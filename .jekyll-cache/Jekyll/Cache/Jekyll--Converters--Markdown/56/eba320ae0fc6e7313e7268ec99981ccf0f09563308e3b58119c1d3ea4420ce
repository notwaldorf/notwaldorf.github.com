I"ï"<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> stands for Llama-DB, and is a database of llamas you can use to debug programs
compiled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang</code> (lldb is to clang like gdb is to gcc). If you already know how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gdb</code>, then
hereâ€™s a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-command-examples.html">translation</a> of the common commands.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: There is a <em>ton</em> of tutorials and pages about all of the
awesome features and commands of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code>, and how to become a debugging pro.
This is not that. This is the smallest set of things you need to read
to answer the question â€œwhatâ€™s making this shit crashâ€. Thatâ€™s it.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-make-it-go">Step 1. Make it go</h2>

<p>If you want to pass a bunch of arguments to your executable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moose</code>, use</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>Â´ â–½ï½€<span class="o">)</span>.ã€‚ï½â™¡ src on fix/moose-crash â˜€ â¥ lldb <span class="nt">--</span> moose arg1 arg2
Current executable <span class="nb">set </span>to <span class="s1">'moose'</span> <span class="o">(</span>x86_64<span class="o">)</span>.</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you donâ€™t have arguments, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb foo</code> is enough. This just tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code>
which executable to care about, but it wonâ€™t actually start the process for you.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> run    <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> Start or re-start your process
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>   <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> Stop your process.</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="step-2-make-it-crash">Step 2. Make it crash</h2>
<p>Since we (me) are investigating a crash, the first thing you need is a stack trace that
tells you where the crash is. So, start your process in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code>, make it crash, and weâ€™ll take it
from there.</p>

<p>Side bar: I literally typed this blog out while sorting out a crash in the
sign-in bits of Chromium, so all my screenshots are Chromium code. Do not panic.
Your code can crash just as well if you give it enough time and attention.</p>

<p>Once you hit your crash, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> tells you something like this.
<img src="/images/2014-06-23/crash.png" alt="lldb crash" /></p>

<p>I canâ€™t tell you how excited I am at that little arrow. It <em>almost</em> looks non-intimidating. Almost.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-breakpoints-its-hammer-time">Step 3. Breakpoints! Itâ€™s hammer time</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was set a breakpoint at that line to figure out
whatâ€™s going on right before things got crashy (because Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re dying to
know, my crash was happening because we hit that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCHECK</code> which reads
â€œthe item should always be signed inâ€ and, spoilers, it isnâ€™t)</p>

<p>To set a breakpoint in a file at a specific line:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> breakpoint <span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nt">--file</span> profile_chooser_controller.mm <span class="nt">--line</span> 1509</code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome discovery: you donâ€™t have to give the full path to the file (which in
Chromium is a nightmare). Also, thereâ€™s autocomplete, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profile_&lt;tab&gt;</code> gives you
suggestions and happy feelings.</p>

<p>At this point, I pressed enter a bunch of times (as you do), which ended up
setting that breakpoint 4 times (as it does). So donâ€™t do that. If you ignored that
bit of advice, hereâ€™s some helpful breakpoint-related things you can talk to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> about:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> breakpoint list     <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> numbered list of all dem breakpoints
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> breakpoint <span class="nb">help</span>     <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> this is surprisingly not scary!
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> breakpoint delete 4 <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> deletes the 4th breakpoint
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> breakpoint delete   <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> deletes ALL the things. but warns you first.</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you donâ€™t like typing, all these commands have super l33t
shortcuts like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br s -f moose.c -l 12</code>. This intimidates me seven ways to Sunday,
since Iâ€™ve <em>just</em> learnt how to set a breakpoint, and I had to do it on the command
line and I like UIs, but if thatâ€™s your jam,
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-command-examples.html">here</a> is that list.
Go forth and conquer.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve already started your executable and forgot to set a breakpoint, itâ€™s OK!
Just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+C</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> to pause your program and clean up your room before
your friends come over. When youâ€™re done, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue</code> to resume your process. Amazing!</p>

<h2 id="intermission-playing-with-stack-traces">Intermission: Playing with stack traces</h2>
<p>Current status: weâ€™ve run our code, weâ€™ve hit the breakpoint. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> rewards you
with a snippet of code around that point. Dat arrow. â¤ï¸</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-06-23/breakpoint.png" alt="lldb breakpoint" /></p>

<p>More things that you can probably want to do here:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> thread backtrace    <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> stack trace of how we got here
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> up                  <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> move up the stack trace to your parent callee</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="step-4-poke-at-things">Step 4: Poke at things</h2>
<p>Once youâ€™re paused, you can inspect the value of a variable in that scope. You
probably want to do that because 90% of the time a thing that shouldnâ€™t be null
is null, because C++.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> frame variable viewMode_</code></pre></figure>

<p>To step through things, get in the llama car, close the door, and start navimagating:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> step   <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> step into the call at this line. Alias <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s1">'thread step-inst'</span>
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> next   <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> skip to the next line. Alias <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s1">'thread step-in'</span>
<span class="o">(</span>lldb<span class="o">)</span> finish <span class="nt">--</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> step out of this call. Terrible <span class="nb">alias </span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="s1">'thread step-out'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If at any point you want to restart your process, just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run</code> again. Donâ€™t worry,
itâ€™s not destructive â€“ youâ€™ll be asked to confirm if you really want to blow
away the frame youâ€™re in. Bam!</p>

<h3 id="thats-it">Thatâ€™s it!</h3>
<p>For realsies! You and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lldb</code> should probably get friendship bracelets now.</p>
