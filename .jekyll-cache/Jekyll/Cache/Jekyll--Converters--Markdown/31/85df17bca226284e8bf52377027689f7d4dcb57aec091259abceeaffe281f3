    <p>I skipped week 5 because all I did in the panna cotta was watch 3 seasons of
“how to get away with murder”. It’s a terrible show and I’m not ashamed of it.</p>
  </li>

    <p>What is up with that star codex thing? I can’t believe there was a cult of
assholes in tech I didn’t know about. I’m obviously not surprised they existed,
there’s an asshole under every rock in tech; I’m just surprised I didn’t know
about it. I’m a person in the know! I have an invite to Dispo!</p>

    <p>I watched the #freebritney documentary and I think that a) the concept of a conservatorship for a grown ass 40 year old woman is fucked and b) her dad being
a mysoginistic asshole is 80% of the reason she’s on one. Nobody
put Kanye in a corner when he was going bonkers; we let him run for
president and bought his shitty 20 minute long album to make fun of it and talked about how he prolly needs to take his meds but oh well,
famous people amirite. But if a woman goes a bit bonkers and in the process
shaves her head (we all know women aren’t allowed to shave their heads), then suddenly she needs to be in a legal monetary prison for life? Rich people waste their
money ALL the time, why is she the different one? Makes you think.</p>

    <p>I also think it’s the cherry on the cake that because her dad is “managing” her
estate she is essentially paying both for her lawyers to try to help her,
and for the opposing lawyers to try to screw her.</p>

    <p>I’ve been working on a lot of generative art. This is good, because I’m making
things and I want to open a store so people can put my things on their walls,
but bad because when I make art and keep looking at it I end up violently hating it, and that spirals out of control into a “everything I do is basic and derivative” mood which tbh makes me feel like shit. I had a nice chat with @mrmrs who is 100x more talented than me but feels similarly about his art sometimes, so I felt very seen.</p>

    <p>We drove to Arizona this weekend. We are still doing nothing but now it’s
nothing around cactuses and the desert. I’ve been trying to find ways to get myself
to move more, and I read in Alice’s notes that she tried out geocaching, so I installed an app last night! I thought there would be like a geocache per state, but there’s millions. There are 2 geocaches within a 2 mile walk! If there’s no week 7 notes it’s
either because nothing happened or because I died trying to get to this cache. The halting
problem is a hell of a thing.</p>
