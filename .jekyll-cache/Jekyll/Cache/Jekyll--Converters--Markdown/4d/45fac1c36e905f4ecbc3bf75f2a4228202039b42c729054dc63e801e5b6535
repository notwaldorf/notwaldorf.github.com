I"—<p>Itâ€™s been  <del>one week since you looked at me</del> 8 months since Iâ€™ve been writing these weekly notes, and
I think Iâ€™m going to take a small break from it. Itâ€™s been a good experiment, but Iâ€™ve been getting sloppy with remembering theyâ€™re due, and itâ€™s starting to feel a bit self-indulgent. Because I donâ€™t actually advertise that they exist, I donâ€™t think anyone reads them, so Iâ€™m not entirely sure why Iâ€™m writing them if nobody on either side of the fence is particularly amused by the experience. I do have a blog post in the barrel which is a rare and momentuous occasion yâ€™all can look forward to.</p>

<p>xoxo,
monica</p>
