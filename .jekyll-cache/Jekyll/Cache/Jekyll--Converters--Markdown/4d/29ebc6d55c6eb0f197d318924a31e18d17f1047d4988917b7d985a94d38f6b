    <p>Ya look at that? It’s May already. My dog’s is turning 2 on the 14th, does anyone have any
good dog cake recipes or should I just give her an almost-empty jar of peanut butter with the same
success rate?</p>

    <p>I got my second fouchie outchie! (#teampfizer). I wouldn’t say it bodied me the next day,
but I felt uncomfortable enough to sit in bed and read not one but TWO Bridgerton novels. I’ve 
now read 1-4 and I think I’m done for a while.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of books, I’m finishing up On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (Ocean Vuong; reads like poetry
but isn’t. Review next time), and I’m about to start up The Vanishing Half (Brit Bennett; very 2021 book cover). I also finished a book in Romanian, translated from Russian: Zuleiha opens her eyes (Guzel Yakhina. Really beautiful, much more hopeful and uplifting than the Russian literature I’m used to.)</p>

    <p>After 15+ years of living in North America, I think I am “into” oatmeal. Oatmeal isn’t a Romanian thing
at all – oats are for horses, cream of wheat is for babies, adults don’t eat either. Current
approach: 1. overnight oats (in water, cashew milk makes them too…intense and I don’t give money
to the meat industry for cow milk) + either apple sauce (that I make because I keep forgetting to eat apples), or frozen fruit.</p>

    <p>Other food shit I’m obsessed with right now: ingesting industrial quantities of watermelon, these
<a href="https://gimmedelicious.com/keto-peanut-butter-cookies/">keto peanut butter cookies</a> (I don’t eat keto,
but pb cookies with no-guilt-sugar are delicius), cashew milk.</p>

    <p>Arts: I am deeply struggling with a 3 layer linocut. I’ve carved it like 3+ times, and no matter how I do it I can’t line up all the 3 layers well. I think it’s time to give up on it and make it into a digital print. Also, I’ve been working on L-systems, which make pretty trees. Should I write a blog post about that when it’s done?</p>
