I"»<p>I talked about <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/cat-dns">Cat-DNS</a> at <a href="http://2014.cascadiajs.com/">Cascadia.js</a>, and it wasnâ€™t terrible! There is a video. Of me talking! On the internet! What a future we live in.</p>

<h2>=^..^=</h2>
<p>The internet needs more cats. DNS servers are the authority on all things internet.
Therefore, the best DNS server is the one that resolves everything to cats. This talk is about that.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re going to walk through the basics and find out how DNS servers work, how you can talk to a
DNS server if youâ€™re a browser, and how to talk back to a browser if you are a DNS server. Iâ€™ll show you how you
can write your own DNS server in less than 200 lines of JavaScript, but perhaps most importantly, why you probably
shouldnâ€™t.</p>

<p>And have I mentioned the cats? There are definitely cats.</p>
