<p>For the last decade I've been working on user centered projects, from delivering a feature to the billions
of users of Chrome, to taking a machine learning model and making it relevant to someone with no technical
training. Nowadays I work freelance as a tech advisor or consultant, helping teams understand their
users and their processes.</p>

<p>I can help your team with:
<h3>Engineering problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>prototyping</b>: build a small prototype while you're still figuring out your tech, that you can use 
to research and develop new features</li>
<li><b>user experience design/research</b>: work with you to design interactions that are easy to use 
and intuitive for your users</li>
<li><b>data visualizations</b>: tell a story through your data, in a way that is 
easy to understand, self explanatory and interesting</li>
<li><b>advising</b>: answer technical questions about web best practices (eg. the performance and accessibility 
  of your product), do code reviews, or offer feedback and suggestions for improvement.</li>  
</ul>
<h3>Human problems</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>project scoping</b>: figure out and prioritize the core features of your application based
  on what your users actually need</li>
<li><b>debugging your team</b>: help you figure out why your team might be stuck and have trouble
focusing on features or delivering them</li>
<li><b>mentorship, guidance & leadership</b>: brainstorm creative ideas, offer feedback on your
written materials and presentations, and help you craft your key messaging.</li>

</ul>
