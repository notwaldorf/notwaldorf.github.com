<p>For the last decade I've been working on user centered projects, from delivering a feature to the billions
of users of Chrome, to taking a machine learning model and making it relevant to someone with no technical
training. Nowadays I work freelance as a tech advisor or consultant, helping teams understand their
users and their processes.</p>

<p>I can help your team with:
<ul>
<li><b>project scoping</b>: figure out and prioritize the core features of your application based
on what the users actually need</li>
<li><b>user experience design/research</b>: work with you to design interactions that are easy to use 
and intuitive for your users</li>
<li><b>data visualizations</b>: tell a story through your data, in a way that is 
easy to understand, self explanatory and interesting</li>
<li><b>debugging your team</b>: help you figure out why your team might be stuck and have trouble
focusing on features or delivering them</li>
<li><b>engineering</b>: answer technical questions about web best practices and the performance and accessibily 
of your product, do code reviews, or offer feedback and suggestions for improvement</li>
<li><b>mentorship, guidance & leadership</b>: I can help you brainstorm creative ideas, offer feedback on your
written materials and presentations and help you craft your key messaging.</li>

</ul>
