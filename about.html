<p>In 2021 I ended an 8 year adventure as a Senior Engineer at Google. Since then,
  I've been working with companies on creative projects, prototyping, or advising 
  their engineering teams. Some of the bigger companies I've worked with (that I can talk about)
  include Google, <a href="https://gorevel.com/">Revel</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US">Moderna</a>.
  </p>
<p>My last project before quitting Google was <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>
  making music and art with Machine Learning; I built the majority of the
  users-and-model interactions, such as <a href="https://glitch.com/@magenta">these ones</a>.
  Here's the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lyEjtKQAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a>
  I was on during that time.</p>
  
<p>In 2020 I also did a 6 month fellowship
  with the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">Trevor project</a>, where I lead a team 
  that worked on classifying suicidal ideation posts on a social media platform.</p>

<p>Prior to 2018, I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
  and was a big advocate for Web Components in both the open source and standards communities.
  I maintained and owned one of the first (and at the time, largest!) 
  <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-elements">suite</a> of 
  custom elements. During this time I was also a member of the Emoji subcommittee, which 
  is a career high <span class="og">üòÉ </span>.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I used to work on
  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner
  of your browser? Yeah, I did that (but now it looks different.
  It's been 6+ years after all). Before <i>that</i>, in the prehistoric times, I worked in finance, despite
  not really understanding or caring about it. I have a masters in Computer Science
  from <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I wrote a thesis on Reinforcement Learning,
  which you can read <a href="/includes/mdinculescu_thesis.pdf">here</a>, though I'm not sure why you would.

<p>I've recently started focusing less on tech and more on art, which is something I've wanted to do all my 
  life! You can see how that is going on my <a href="https://meownica.studio">studio page</a>.

<h3><span class="og">‚ú® </span> Do you want us to work together?</h3>
<p>I am available for freelance work in a consulting capacity, or as a tech advisor
for your company. My areas of expertise are the web platform, creative 
  applications and interactions, and usable machine learning. I care deeply about users,
  performance, accessibility, and having things be functional. I am especially interested in (creative) 
  projects
  that help people create things, public sector organizations and non profits.</p>

<h3><span class="og">‚òéÔ∏é </span> Do you want to just say hi?</h3>
<p><s>My social media hell of choice is <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Twitter</a>, where I'm pretty responsive. </s>
  I also have a GitHub AMA <a
    href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a>
  where you can ask me things, or read what other people have asked me.
  If you really need to, you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>,
  but know that it'll take me an embarassing time to reply.
  It's not you, it's misplaced anxiety.</p>

<h3><span class="og">‚Åâ </span> What are these cute emoji?</h3>
<p>
Why, thank you for asking! They are from the original Docomo emoji set, 
from the birth of time (2001). A while back I made
<a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/og-emoji-font/">a font of them</a>, and this year I 
decided I hadn't been using them enough.
