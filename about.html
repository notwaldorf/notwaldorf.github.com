<p>I just ended an 8 year adventure as a Senior Engineer at Google. My most 
  recent team was <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>
  making music and art with Machine Learning; I built the majority of the
  user-and-model interactions, such as <a href="https://glitch.com/@magenta">these ones</a>.
  Here's the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lyEjtKQAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a>
  I was on during that time.</p>
  
<p>In 2020 I also did a 6 month fellowship
  with the <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">Trevor project</a>, where I lead a team 
  that worked on classifying suicidal ideation posts on a social media platform.</p>

<p>Prior to 2018, I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
  and was a big advocate for Web Components in both the open source and standards communities.
  I maintained and owned one of the first (and at the time, largest!) 
  <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/collection/PolymerElements/paper-elements">suite</a> of 
  custom elements. During this time I was also a member of the Emoji subcommittee, which 
  is a career high <span class="og">üòÉ </span>.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I used to work on
  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner
  of your browser? Yeah, I did that (but now it looks different.
  It's been 6+ years after all). Before <i>that</i>, in the prehistoric times, I worked in finance, despite
  not really understanding or caring about it. I have a masters in Computer Science
  from <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I wrote a thesis on Reinforcement Learning,
  which you can read <a href="/includes/mdinculescu_thesis.pdf">here</a>, though I'm not sure why you would.

<p>I've recently started making more art and selling it on my <a href="https://meownica.studio">online shop</a>, 
which is something I've wanted to do all my life!</p>

<h3><span class="og">‚ú® </span> Do you want us to work together?</h3>
<p>I am available for freelance work in a <b>consulting</b> capacity (not as a full-time engineer), or as a tech advisor
for your company. My areas of expertise are the web platform, creative 
  applications and interactions, and usable machine learning. I care deeply about users,
  performance, accessibility, and having things be functional. I am especially interested in (creative) 
  projects
  that help people create things, public sector organizations and non profits.</p>

  work together, check out the ways in which I can <a href="/work">help your company</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="og">‚òéÔ∏é </span> Do you want to just say hi?</h3>
<p>My social media hell of choice is <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Twitter</a>, where I'm pretty responsive. 
  I also have a GitHub AMA <a
    href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a>
  where you can ask me things, or read what other people have asked me.
  If you really need to, you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>,
  but know that it'll take me an embarassing time to reply.
  It's not you, it's misplaced anxiety.</p>

<h3><span class="og">üìù </span> Are you a conference and need a bio?</h3>
<p>Monica is a creative coder and recovering software engineer that likes to build silly things. In the past she's worked
  on Magenta, machine learning, web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you.
  She is passionate about delightful user experiences, unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will
  become your best friend if you bring her
  cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.</p>

<p>If you need a headshot, I recommend <a href="https://meowni.ca/images/headshot.jpg">this
    one</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.pujaarajan.com">Pujaa Rajan</a> for
  making me look like a respectable adult!)</p>

<h3><span class="og">‚Åâ </span> What are these cute emoji?</h3>
<p>
Why, thank you for asking! They are from the original Docomo emoji set, 
from the birth of time (2001). A while back I made
<a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/og-emoji-font/">a font of them</a>, and this year I 
decided I hadn't been using them enough.
